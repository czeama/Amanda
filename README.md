## Project Overview ðŸ’¡
The Team Management project aims to enhance the management of project teams within the WAIT organization. WAIT is dedicated to executing projects in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Science, and Business Intelligence (BI). By analyzing data regarding the competencies of team members, this project seeks to improve the processes involved in forming effective project teams. The overarching goal is to leverage data-driven insights to create well-balanced, high-performing teams.


## Business Context 
WAIT undertakes projects that address real business challenges, following the Passion Based Learning (PBL) methodology. This approach encourages learning and skill acquisition among individuals connected by common interests, who learn from one another.

## Problem to Solve
Currently, WAIT has data on the declared competencies of individuals willing to work on projects, but lacks insight into how these competencies are distributed and can be effectively utilized. 

**The project's challenge is to extract valuable insights 
from the collected data, which will aid in constructing efficient project teams.**

## Machine Learning Methods
To achieve the objectives, the project will employ machine learning techniques, including clustering, to segment WAIT members. This analysis aims to:

- Identify distinct groups of users based on their competencies.
- Derive interesting insights about the structure and potential of the WAIT community.

## Project Goals
1. Verify the existence of distinguishable user groups within the WAIT community.
2. Analyze available data to provide valuable insights regarding the WAIT community.
3. Teach participants the basics of working on a Data Science project, emphasizing quality to ensure the final product can be added to their CVs as a public repository example.
